# github-pr-review-max-view

## This is a firefox [web-extension](https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebExtensions)

The diff-view in github's web-ui does not scale well with the zoom/font-size, leading to a small portion of the window width  being used to render  code-diffs when viewing pull-requests.

This script updates the diff-view width to be the full width of the window.

## tl;dr  
Maximise the code-diff view width in pull-requests.
